I have always loved the yearly r/place subreddit. I think it's where the internet shines. Ofcourse there are some questionable things drawn there, but its cool how people can come together from across the world.

I wanted to try to build something similar using WebSockets in NodeJS.

Start the websocket server by running `node server.js` and start the app either with a simple Python server (`python3 -m http.server 9000`) or by using the Live Server VSCode extension.
